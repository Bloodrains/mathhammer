The codebase is split into two parts.

The legacy code, written for desktop usage using PyQt4, resides in mathhammer-qt. It is not well organized or well documented, but it serves as the basis for the online code.

Qt4 and the PyQt4 bindings are required to run this, as well as numpy (numeric python by Enthought)

The app engine app is located in the app-engine directory.
